If you want to start working, make sure you pull any changes team members made
    First make sure you're in main by running
        - git branch (to check)
        or just 
        - git switch main
    Then run
        - git pull?

If you want to work in your own branch, then after pulling into main
    - git switch BranchName
    - git merge main

If the changes you made are in main, push when you are done working
    - git add .
    - git commit -m "commit message goes here, make it related to what you changed"
    - git push

If the changes you made are in a branch, push when you are done and merge if safe to do so
    While still in your branch
        - git add .
        - git commit -m "commit message"
        - git push origin BranchName
    Then, if you're going to merge, switch to main
        - git switch main
    Merge and push 
        - git merge BranchName
        - git push

If you want to create a branch
    - git branch NewBranchName

If you want to see what branch you're in and what you can switch to
    - git branch

If you want to switch to a different branch
    - git switch BranchName
